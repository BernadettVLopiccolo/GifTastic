# GifTastic

In this assignment, I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. To finish this task, I called the GIPHY API and used JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of my site.

When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
